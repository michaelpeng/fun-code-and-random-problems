# random-fun-code
Miscellaneous snippets of code and random problems on which I've worked.

* __num_of_Dropbox_employees.py__: Asynchronously prints waiting statement while parsing Dropbox's About page to count number of [publicly-listed] employees. Deprecated: Dropbox has since removed the About page on which employees were listed.

* __cube_sum_equality.py__: Prints all positive integer solutions to the equation a<sup>3</sup> + b<sup>3</sup> = c<sup>3</sup> + d<sup>3</sup> for n from 1 to 1000. Only non-trivial solutions are printed (trivial solutions are those having the same the same a, b terms on one side as as x, y terms on the other side, and/or is a solution grouping of a, b, c, d that is a permutation of another existing solution). Adapted from Cracking the Coding Interview, 6th Edition, problem, when I noticed that the pseudocode proivided in the solution doesn't quite seem to work.

* __folding.py__: Prints length of longest "folding subsequence" as defined by [this gist](https://gist.github.com/whoshuu/6ec6da7ecb50834817a0).
